    description: skos:closeMatch is used to link two concepts that are sufficiently
      similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval
      applications. In order to avoid the possibility of "compound errors" when combining
      mappings across more than two concept schemes, skos:closeMatch is not declared
      to be a transitive property.

  mappingRelation:
    name: mappingRelation
    description: Relates two concepts coming, by convention, from different schemes,
      and that have comparable meanings
    comments:
    - These concept mapping relations mirror semantic relations, and the data model
      defined below is similar (with the exception of skos:exactMatch) to the data
      model defined for semantic relations. A distinct vocabulary is provided for
      concept mapping relations, to provide a convenient way to differentiate links
      within a concept scheme from links between concept schemes. However, this pattern
      of usage is not a formal requirement of the SKOS data model, and relies on informal
      definitions of best practice.
