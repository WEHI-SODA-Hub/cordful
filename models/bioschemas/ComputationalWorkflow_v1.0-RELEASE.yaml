    comments:
    - A computational workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern
      of activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into processes
      that transform materials, provide services, or process information (source Wikipedia.org).
      It is executed by a computational process and is thus distinct from laboratory
      or business workflows. version 1.0-RELEASE
