    comments:
    - To deliver on the identified use cases for samples, we have identified a minimal
      set of properties to encapsulate identification, linking, and metadata descriptions.
      Some of these properties are existing standard schema.org properties, others
      require Bioschemas extensions. Table 1 outlines the minimal set of properties
      for the ‘Sample’ concept and Table 2 shows our recommendations for use of the
      ‘PropertyValue’ concept to markup additional characteristics of a sample described
      within a sample page. We also propose a new concept, ‘Biomedical Code’, which
      is a generalisation of the existing ‘Medical Code’ concept defined in the health-lifesci.schema.org
      extension.
