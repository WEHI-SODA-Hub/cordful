    - A controlled vocabulary term equivalent to this entity. For instance, an organism
      coined in NCBI taxonomy can be represented as a BioChemEntity. As it also exists
      as a term in an ontology, it would be nice to capture that information via categoryCode.

    - "A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity,\
      \ e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching\
      \ property in schema.org. \n Note: Publishers should be aware that applications\
      \ designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,\
      \ http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, â€¦) will typically expect\
      \ such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic\
      \ property/value mechanism. \n Whenever possible, please use a property coined\
      \ in a third-party well-known vocabulary. For instance, you can directly use\
      \ RO ObjectProperty: enables as a property to express how a protein or gene\
      \ enables some GO molecular function. If you still want or need to use additionalProperty,\
      \ please use (i) property name to specify the name of the property, (ii) additionalType\
      \ (if possible) to better specify the nature of the property, and (iii) value\
      \ to link to the object/range of this property. We recommend to look at the\
      \ OBO Relations Ontology (RO) or the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO)\
      \ as starting points. \n Bioschemas Protein: If no suitable property exists\
      \ in this profile, use any ontology term coined as a property and suitable for\
      \ your needs. For instance sio:SIO_000095 (is member of) could be used to model\
      \ the relation between a protein and a protein clan."
