    - 'Bioschemas specification for describing a computational workflow in the Life
      Sciences A computational workflow consists of an orchestrated and repeatable
      pattern of activity enabled by the systematic organization of resources into
      processes that transform materials, provide services, or process information
      (source Wikipedia.org). It is executed by a computational process and is thus
      distinct from laboratory or business workflows. Version: 0.5-DRAFT-2020_07_21'
