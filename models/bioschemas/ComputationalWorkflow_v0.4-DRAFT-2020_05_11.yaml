    - 'Bioschemas specification for describing a workflow in the Life Sciences A workflow
      consists of an orchestrated and repeatable pattern of activity enabled by the
      systematic organization of resources into processes that transform materials,
      provide services, or process information. It can be depicted as a sequence of
      operations, the work of a person or group, the work of an organization of staff,
      or one or more simple or complex mechanisms. (source Wikipedia.org) Version:
