    - A controlled vocabulary term equivalent to this entity. For instance, an organism
      coined in NCBI taxonomy can be represented as a BioChemEntity. As it also exists
      as a term in an ontology, it would be nice to capture that information via categoryCode.

    - "A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity,\
      \ e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching\
      \ property in schema.org. \n Note: Publishers should be aware that applications\
      \ designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,\
      \ http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, â€¦) will typically expect\
      \ such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic\
      \ property/value mechanism. \n As much a possible, do not use it! Alternatively,\
      \ consider reusing properties/relations already coined in controlled vocabularies.\
      \ We recommed to look at the OBO Relations Ontology (RO) or the Semanticscience\
      \ Integrated Ontology (SIO) as starting points."

      \ \n For proteins, it is recommended to at least specify the taxon/organism\
      \ associated to the described protein. For taxon/organism, it is a good practice\
      \ to use hasCategoryCode to point to a controlled vacabulary such as NCBI taxon\
      \ or UniProt Taxonomy. Including as well the GO cellular locations is optional;\
      \ for cellular locations it is a good practice to use hasCategorryCode to point\
      \ to a GO Cellular Location term."
