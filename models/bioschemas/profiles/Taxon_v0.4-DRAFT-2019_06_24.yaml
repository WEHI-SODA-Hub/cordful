    - A controlled vocabulary term equivalent to this entity. For instance, an organism
      coined in NCBI taxonomy can be represented as a BioChemEntity. As it also exists
      as a term in an ontology, it would be nice to capture that information via categoryCode.

    - 'Bioschemas profile for describing a biological taxon This profile aims to denote
      a taxon by common properties such as its scientific name, taxonomic rank and
      vernacular names. It is also a means to link to existing taxonomic registers
      where each taxon has a URI. <br/>Changes in 0.4: <ul> <li>taxonRank promoted
      to minimal marginality</li><li>parentTaxon, childTaxon and taxonRank are in
      namespace bioschemas.org until they be eventually accepted into schema.org.</li><li>scientificName
      and scientificNameAuthorship removed</li></ul> Version: 0.4-DRAFT-2019_06_24'
