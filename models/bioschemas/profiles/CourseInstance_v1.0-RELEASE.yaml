    - 'Specification describing the instance of a course.  This specification can
      be used in tandem with a Course. A course is used to describe the broad, common
      aspects of a recurring training event - whereas a course instance is about the
      specific times and location of when that course is held. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    No
      changes since 0.9-DRAFT of the CourseInstance profile. Version: 1.0-RELEASE
      (13 September 2022)'
