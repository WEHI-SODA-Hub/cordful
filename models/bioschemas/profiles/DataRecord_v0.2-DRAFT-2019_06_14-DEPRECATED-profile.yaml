    - "A property-value pair representing an additional characteristics of the entitity,\
      \ e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is no matching\
      \ property in schema.org. Note: Publishers should be aware that applications\
      \ designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,\
      \ http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, â€¦) will typically expect\
      \ such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic\
      \ property/value mechanism. \n Additional to the use of name and description\
      \ to describe this property in a human-readable way, additionalType should be\
      \ used to specify the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if the\
      \ property refers to a gene/protein disease association, you could use SIO:000983\
      \ (gene-disease association) as the additionalType for the additionalProperty."
