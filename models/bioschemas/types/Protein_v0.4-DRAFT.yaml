    comments:
    - Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino
      acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota
      (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are
      all of type schema:Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein,
      e.g. schema:Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it
      which would also be schema:Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical
      or naturally occurring. This version has been added to schema.org as a pending
      type.
