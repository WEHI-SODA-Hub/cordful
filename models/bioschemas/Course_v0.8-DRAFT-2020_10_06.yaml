    - 'Specification describing a course.  This specification must be used in tandem
      with a courseInstance. A course is used to describe the broad, common aspects
      of a recurring training event - whereas a course instance is about the specific
      times and location of when that course is held. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes
