    - 'Bioschemas profile describing a Gene in Life Sciences This Gene profile specification
      presents the markup for describing a Gene. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4> Changes
      introduced on Gene profile 0.6-DRAFT-2020_04_02 in response to <a href="https://github.com/Bioschemas/specifications/issues/353">issue
      353</a><ul><li>encodes property updated to encodesBioChemEntity, still recommended</li><li>additionalProperty
      removed</li><li>associatedDisease range updated</li><li>examples using DefinedTerm
      now include link to external vocabularies via property inDefinedTermSet (hasMolecularFunction,
      isInvolvedInBiologicalProcess, taxonomicRange). Note: isTranscribedInto and
      isVariantOf do not exist on the Gene type so they were removed, isVariantOf
      was replaced on Gene type by alternativeOf)</li><li>hasCategoryCode property
      removed</li></ul>Additional changes after looking at BioChemEntity and Gene
      types:<ul><li>hasRepresentation moved to optional. There is another property</li><li>hasBioPolymerSequence
      for the sequence text. hasRepresentation can be used to link to a page containing
      the corresponding sequence so both are  now optional and people can decide which
      one suits better to them</li><li>properties directly from Gene type not previously
      included on the Gene profile were added as optional (expressedIn and hasStatus)</li></ul>
