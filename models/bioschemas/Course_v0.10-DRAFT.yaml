    - 'Specification describing a course.  This specification must be used in tandem
      with a courseInstance. A course is used to describe the broad, common aspects
      of a recurring training event - whereas a course instance is about the specific
      times and location of when that course is held. <h4>Summary of Changes</h4>    Changes
      since previous draft 0.9 of the Course profile:    <ul>      <li>Removes Bioschemas
      description from _mentions_ property ''If this varies in a *CourseInstance*,
      use the *CourseInstance* version of _mentions_ to override this mentions.''</li>         </ul>
      Version: 0.10-DRAFT (16 August 2022)'
